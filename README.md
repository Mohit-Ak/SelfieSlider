# SelfieSlider
An innovative way of digital marketing exploiting the untapped opportunity of Monetizing Selfies.

“24 Billion Selfies taken during 2016”- Google

## Selfies with products act as:
- Endorsements.
- Positive Reviews

## Problems that exist in current ECommerce Scenario:
- No accurate way to recognize products in selfies.
- The content of the pictures was only extracted using hashtags.
- Not everything can be #hashtagged.

## The proposal 
- To integrate a SELFIE Carousel in the “Product Display Page” of an e-Commerce website.
- The user will be able to view the SELFIE’s of people he knows (or) follows (or) admires who have bought the given product.
- Customers with product Selfies are a social proof that other buyers crave.
- Potential customers are indirectly encouraged from people they know, like and trust.
- Prevents them from reading long reviews about the product
- Decreasing the overall shopping time.
- A new structured channel of endorsement.
